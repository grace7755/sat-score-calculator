---

---

## MoSCoW Prioritization

### üî¥ MUST HAVE (Mandatory for AdSense Approval)

These items are **non-negotiable** requirements. Without them, AdSense approval is impossible.

#### M1: Create About Us Page ‚≠ê CRITICAL
**Priority:** HIGHEST  
**Deadline:** Before reapplying  
**File:** `/about.html`

**Requirements:**
- Minimum 500-800 words of original content
- Clear explanation of:
  - Who you are / who runs the site
  - Why you created this tool
  - Your mission/purpose
  - What makes your calculator reliable
  - Educational background (if applicable)
  - Why visitors should trust your content
- Professional tone
- Include link in main navigation and footer

**Why it's critical:** Google requires transparency about website ownership. This establishes credibility and is a mandatory AdSense requirement verified by multiple sources.

**Implementation Status:** ‚ùå NOT CREATED

---

#### M2: Create Contact Us Page ‚≠ê CRITICAL
**Priority:** HIGHEST  
**Deadline:** Before reapplying  
**File:** `/contact.html`

  - Clear email address prominently displayed
- Optional but recommended:
  - Response time expectations

- Include link in main navigation and footer

**Why it's critical:** Google requires easy visitor communication. A footer email link alone is insufficient. This is a documented AdSense requirement.

**Implementation Status:** ‚ùå NOT CREATED

---

#### M3: Update Sitemap.xml ‚≠ê CRITICAL
**Priority:** HIGHEST  
**Deadline:** Immediately after creating new pages  
**File:** `/sitemap.xml`

**Good News:** These are straightforward to fix! With the MUST HAVE items completed (2 new pages + 10 blog articles), you'll have strong foundation for reapplication.

**Realistic Timeline:** 6-8 weeks to implement MUST HAVE and SHOULD HAVE items, then reapply.

Based on the latest 2025 SEO best practices, here are the **top 10 requirements to write a complete SEO-friendly article**:

## 1. **Target Search Intent & Provide Real Value**
SEO-friendly content should also engage users, include appropriate meta descriptions and title tags, and fulfill specific search intent. Your article must directly answer what users are actually searching for and provide comprehensive, actionable value that satisfies their query completely.

## 2. **Optimize for AI and LLMs** 
The SEO landscape in 2025 demands more than just strong writing skills. You must write with both humans and machines in mind to succeed at writing for search engine optimizationâ€”crafting content that's concise, semantically rich, and structured for maximum extractability. Structure content so AI systems can easily extract and reference key information.

## 3. **Create Compelling Title Tags and Meta Descriptions**
Write relevant meta descriptions that give readers a reason to click to read your content from the search results and Include your primary keyword in your title tag (preferably at the beginning). Keep your title tag around 55 characters long.

## 4. **Structure Content with Clear Hierarchy**
Break up long content into paragraphs and sections, and provide headings to help users navigate your pages. Use H1, H2, H3 tags logically to create scannable, well-organized content that both users and search engines can easily understand.

## 5. **Focus on Readability and Quality Writing**
Write content naturally and make sure the content is well written, easy to follow, and free of spelling and grammatical mistakes. Avoid keyword stuffing and prioritize natural, engaging writing that keeps readers on your page.

## 6. **Implement Strategic Keyword Optimization**
Research and naturally incorporate your primary keyword and related semantic keywords throughout your content. Focus on long-tail keywords and topic clusters rather than single keyword targeting to match modern search patterns.

## 7. **Optimize for Core Web Vitals and Page Speed**
Ensure fast loading times, mobile responsiveness, and excellent user experience metrics. Search engines prioritize pages that provide smooth, fast interactions across all devices.

## 8. **Include Internal and External Links**
Add relevant internal links to other pages on your site and authoritative external links to credible sources. This builds topic authority and helps search engines understand your content's context and relevance.

## 9. **Add Structured Data and Schema Markup**
Use JSON-LD: Google's preferred format is JSON-LD scripts to help search engines better understand and display your content in rich results, increasing click-through rates.

## 10. **Create Comprehensive, In-Depth Content**
Write thorough, authoritative content that covers topics comprehensively. Longer, well-researched articles that become go-to resources in your niche tend to rank better and attract more backlinks naturally.

**Bonus Tip:** Regularly update your content to maintain freshness and relevance, as search engines favor current, accurate information that reflects the latest developments in your topic area.

These requirements focus on creating content that serves both users and search engines effectively in 2025's evolved SEO landscape.

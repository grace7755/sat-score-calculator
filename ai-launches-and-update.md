Here’s a quick roundup of notable **AI launches & updates in October 2025**:

### OpenAI

* **ChatGPT Atlas (new AI browser)** — Launched **Oct 21** on macOS with a ChatGPT sidebar, “Agent Mode” for task automation, and plans for Windows/iOS/Android. Designed to challenge Chrome; early coverage notes the market impact. ([Reuters][1])
* **Sora 2 upgrades** — Mid-October updates add **storyboards** (beta) and **longer clips**: up to **15s for everyone**, **25s for Pro** (web). Policy tightening around likeness/deepfakes followed industry pushback. ([OpenAI Help Center][2])

### Anthropic

* **Claude Haiku 4.5 (small, fast, cheap)** — Released **Oct 15**. Anthropic says it delivers **Sonnet-4-level coding** at **one-third the cost** and **>2× the speed**; public pricing widely reported as **$1/M input tokens** and **$5/M output**. ([Anthropic][3])

### Perplexity

* **Comet browser (public release)** — Went **free and globally available Oct 2** after a limited rollout, positioning as an AI-first browser with built-in assistant. ([PPC Land][4])

### Databricks (platform)

* **October platform ship** — Not a model, but notable **AI/agentic** quality-of-life updates this month (e.g., **dashboard & Genie space tagging**, previews/GA toggles). Useful if you’re deploying LLM apps at scale. ([Databricks Documentation][5])

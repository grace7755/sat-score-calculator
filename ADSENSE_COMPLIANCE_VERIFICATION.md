# AdSense Compliance Verification Report — satscorecalculator.io

Date: 2025-10-15

This report verifies whether the fixes from ADSENSE_COMPLIANCE_AUDIT.md were fully implemented across the codebase and live site. No code was changed during this audit; this is read-only analysis with concrete evidence.

## Summary

- Overall status: NOT YET FULLY COMPLIANT for AdSense approval (EU/UK requirements) due to CMP and consent UI gaps.
- Major items PASSED: Pre-consent AdSense removal, consent gating in code, required policy pages, ads.txt.
- Major items FAILING: Certified CMP not configured nor loaded site‑wide; legacy consent UI still present on many pages calling removed functions; header misconfiguration persists.

## Checklist vs. Recommended Fix List

1) CMP compliance (Critical) — FAIL
- Evidence:
  - `cmp-config.js` exists but `CMP_CONFIG.id` is `"YOUR_CMP_ID_HERE"` (not configured). It intentionally falls back to the custom banner.
  - CMP script inclusion found only on: `index.html` (line ~1772) and `methodology.html` (line ~291). Other pages do not load `cmp-config.js` at all.
- Impact: No IAB TCF string and no certified CMP for EU/UK traffic on most pages; violates Google CMP requirements for AdSense in those regions.
- Affected files (not loading CMP): All blog posts and tool pages (see grep below). They only include `consent-config.js`.

2) Gate AdSense correctly (Critical) — PASS
- Evidence:
  - No direct AdSense script tags in any HTML: no matches for `pagead2.googlesyndication.com` across `**/*.html`.
  - AdSense is only loaded after consent via code in `consent-config.js` (`ConsentManager.loadAdSense()`).
- Impact: Pre-consent loading removed; gating is correctly implemented in JavaScript.

3) Unify and fix consent UI/keys (High) — FAIL (partial)
- Evidence:
  - `consent-config.js` expects elements/keys: `consent-accept-all`, `consent-reject-all`, `consent-settings-btn`, and inputs `consent-analytics`, `consent-ads`, `consent-personalization`.
  - Many pages still use the legacy modal and call removed functions `acceptAllConsent()`, `rejectAllConsent()`, `showCustomizeConsent()`, `closeCustomizeConsent()`, `saveCustomConsent()` and legacy input IDs `analytics-consent`, `advertising-consent`, `functional-consent`.
  - Those functions are no longer defined (removed from `consent-config.js`), so the buttons will throw errors and cannot save consent.
- Impact: On affected pages, users cannot set consent using the visible UI; ads and analytics cannot be properly granted/updated; breaks the consent experience and gating.
- Pages calling legacy functions (non-exhaustive list from grep):
  - `blog/index.html`, `methodology.html`, `sat-superscore-calculator.html`
  - `tools/sat-superscore-calculator/index.html`, `tools/psat-to-sat-predictor/index.html`, `tools/master-gpa-calculator/index.html`
  - Multiple blog posts show legacy IDs and/or handlers (e.g., `blog/accurate-sat-score-calculator.html`, `blog/sat-score-predictor.html`, `blog/sat-score-requirements-top-universities.html`)
- Pages using the new IDs correctly (examples):
  - `index.html`, `terms.html`, `privacy-policy.html`, and several blog articles (e.g., `blog/digital-sat-vs-paper-sat-2025.html`) contain `consent-ads` etc.

4) Post‑approval ad units (Medium) — PENDING (OK to defer)
- Evidence: No `<ins class="adsbygoogle">` placements found (as intended before approval).
- Impact: Not required for approval; add after approval to render ads.

5) Headers cleanup (Low) — FAIL
- Evidence: `vercel.json` sets `Content-Encoding: gzip` for `js|css` assets.
- Impact: Unless assets are pre‑gzipped, this header can corrupt delivery or bypass Vercel’s automatic compression. Not an AdSense blocker but recommended to fix.

## Key Evidence (grep highlights)

- CMP included only on two pages:
  - `methodology.html: <script src="/cmp-config.js"></script>`
  - `index.html: <script src="/cmp-config.js"></script>`
- Legacy onclick handlers still present (examples):
  - `blog/index.html` buttons: `acceptAllConsent()`, `rejectAllConsent()`, `showCustomizeConsent()`, `closeCustomizeConsent()`, `saveCustomConsent()`
  - Similar patterns in tool pages under `/tools/*/index.html`
- Legacy IDs still present (examples): `analytics-consent`, `advertising-consent`, `functional-consent` in multiple pages.
- No direct AdSense tags remaining: 0 matches for `pagead2.googlesyndication.com` in HTML files.

## Required Fixes to Achieve Compliance

1) Finish CMP integration site‑wide (Critical)
- Configure a certified CMP by setting a real `CMP_CONFIG.id` in `cmp-config.js`.
- Include `<script src="/cmp-config.js"></script>` before `consent-config.js` on ALL pages (homepage, policy pages, tools, and every blog page).

2) Standardize the consent UI across all pages (High)
- Replace legacy modal/buttons with the new markup/IDs expected by `consent-config.js`:
  - Buttons: `consent-accept-all`, `consent-reject-all`, `consent-settings-btn`, `consent-settings-close`, `consent-save-settings`
  - Inputs: `consent-analytics`, `consent-ads`, `consent-personalization`
- Remove inline `onclick` calls to deleted functions and rely on `consent-config.js` event listeners.

3) Remove `Content-Encoding: gzip` header from `vercel.json` (Low)
- Keep cache headers; let Vercel manage compression unless serving pre‑compressed assets.

4) (After approval) Add ad unit containers (Medium)
- Add `<ins class="adsbygoogle">` units with fixed sizes and initialize after `ads` consent to avoid CLS.

## Items Confirmed Correct

- Direct AdSense tags removed from all HTML pages.
- AdSense gated behind consent via `ConsentManager.loadAdSense()`.
- Google Consent Mode v2 defaults to denied; GA4 loads only after analytics consent.
- Required pages present: About, Contact, Privacy Policy, Terms; robots.txt and sitemap.xml look correct; ads.txt is valid.

## Conclusion

You have removed pre‑consent AdSense loading and implemented proper gating, which is critical. To pass AdSense review—especially for EU/UK—complete the CMP integration across the entire site and standardize the consent UI/keys everywhere. Also clean up the `vercel.json` header. Once these are addressed, the site should align with Google’s AdSense compliance expectations.

Its Agent Mode can autonomously search for historical context, author backgrounds, and concept explanations while you work through passages."

For basic mistake explanations, regular ChatGPT works fine, but Atlas excels at deeper context building."

            <h2 id="introduction">What is ChatGPT Atlas?</h2>
            <p><strong>ChatGPT Atlas</strong> is OpenAI's advanced version of ChatGPT with <strong>integrated web browsing and Agent Mode</strong>, launched on October 21, 2025. Unlike the standard ChatGPT, Atlas can autonomously browse the internet, research topics in real-time, and operate in "agent mode" where it proactively gathers information to help you.</p>
            
            <p>For SAT Reading specifically, Atlas offers three game-changing capabilities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>🔍 <strong>Autonomous research:</strong> Agent Mode researches passage topics, author backgrounds, and historical context while you work</li>
                <li>📚 <strong>Instant context building:</strong> Browse feature pulls up relevant information about complex passages (founding documents, scientific concepts, literary movements)</li>
                <li>💡 <strong>Advanced reasoning:</strong> More sophisticated analysis of inference questions, rhetorical strategies, and evidence-based questions than standard ChatGPT</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>The catch:</strong> ChatGPT Atlas requires a <strong>ChatGPT Plus subscription ($20/month)</strong>, but it effectively replaces $200+/month private reading tutors.</p>
            
            <div class="cta-box">
                <h3>📊 Establish Your Reading Baseline</h3>
                <p>Before using ChatGPT Atlas, take a practice test to measure your current Reading & Writing score.</p>
                <a href="../index.html" class="cta-button">Calculate Your Current SAT Score →</a>
            </div>
            
            <h2 id="why-atlas">Why Atlas is Perfect for SAT Reading</h2>
            <p>SAT Reading tests your ability to <strong>comprehend complex passages under time pressure</strong>, identify main ideas, analyze evidence, and understand rhetorical strategies. Here's why ChatGPT Atlas excels at helping you master these skills:</p>
            
            <h3>1. Passage Context is Everything</h3>
            <p>The SAT includes passages from <strong>U.S. founding documents, classic literature, social sciences, and natural sciences</strong>. Many students struggle because they lack background knowledge about these topics. Atlas's browsing capability solves this instantly.</p>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>Example: Without Atlas vs. With Atlas</h4>
                <p><strong>Without Atlas:</strong> You encounter a passage from Frederick Douglass's 1852 "What to the Slave is the Fourth of July?" speech. You don't know the historical context, misunderstand his rhetorical purpose, and miss 3 questions.</p>
                
                <p><strong>With Atlas:</strong> Before analyzing questions, you ask Atlas: "Research the historical context of this Frederick Douglass speech." Agent Mode provides: 1852 political climate, abolitionist movement background, Douglass's biography, and the speech's rhetorical significance. You now answer questions with full context and get 3 more correct.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>2. Evidence-Based Questions Need Systematic Analysis</h3>
            <p>40% of SAT Reading questions ask you to find <strong>textual evidence</strong> supporting an answer. Atlas excels at teaching you to trace evidence systematically rather than guessing based on "what sounds right."</p>
            
            <h3>3. Paired Passage Comparison Becomes Easier</h3>
            <p>The SAT includes paired passages where you must compare two authors' perspectives. Atlas can analyze both passages simultaneously, creating comparison tables and highlighting contrasting viewpoints—something human tutors struggle to do quickly.</p>
            
            <h3>4. Instant Mistake Analysis</h3>
            <p>When you get a question wrong, Atlas doesn't just tell you the right answer—it explains <strong>why the wrong answer was tempting, what type of reading error you made, and how to avoid it</strong> in future passages.</p>
            
            <table class="comparison-table">

            <h2 id="setup">Setting Up ChatGPT Atlas for SAT Prep</h2>
            <p>Here's how to configure ChatGPT Atlas optimally for SAT Reading practice:</p>
            
            <div class="step-box">
                <h3>Step 1: Subscribe and Enable Atlas Features</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Sign up for <strong>ChatGPT Plus</strong> at chat.openai.com ($20/month)</li>
                    <li>In settings, enable <strong>"Web Browsing"</strong> and <strong>"Agent Mode"</strong> (look for toggle in advanced settings)</li>
                    <li>Confirm Agent Mode is active—you'll see a small "🌐 Agent" indicator when enabled</li>
                    <li>Test it by asking: "Research the rhetorical strategies in SAT reading passages"—Atlas should browse and return comprehensive information</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step-box">
                <h3>Step 2: Create Your SAT Reading Custom Instructions</h3>
                <p>In ChatGPT settings, add custom instructions to optimize Atlas for SAT prep:</p>
                
                <p><strong>What would you like ChatGPT to know about you:</strong></p>
                <code>I'm preparing for the SAT. My current Reading & Writing score is [YOUR SCORE]. I struggle most with [evidence-based questions / inference questions / paired passages / etc.]. I want detailed explanations that teach me strategies, not just correct answers.</code>
                
                <p><strong>How would you like ChatGPT to respond:</strong></p>
                <code>For SAT reading passages: 1) Analyze questions step-by-step with evidence from text, 2) Explain why wrong answers are incorrect, 3) Identify the type of reading error I made, 4) Suggest strategies to avoid similar mistakes. Use Agent Mode to research passage background when helpful.</code>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step-box">
                <h3>Step 3: Organize Your Practice Materials</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Create a Google Doc or note file labeled "SAT Reading Mistake Log"</li>
                    <li>Bookmark <a href="../index.html">SAT Score Calculator</a> for progress tracking after practice tests</li>
                    <li>Collect official SAT practice tests from Khan Academy or College Board</li>
                    <li>Keep ChatGPT Atlas open in a separate browser tab during review sessions (NOT during timed practice)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h2 id="passage-analysis">Step-by-Step Passage Analysis Method</h2>
            <p>Here's the exact workflow to use ChatGPT Atlas for analyzing any SAT reading passage:</p>
            
            <div class="step-box">
                <h3>Phase 1: Pre-Reading Context (2-3 minutes)</h3>
                <p><strong>Prompt to use:</strong> <em>"I'm about to read this SAT passage [paste passage]. Before I read it, research: 1) What is the source/context of this passage? 2) What should I know about the author or topic? 3) What are common SAT question types for this passage genre?"</em></p>
                
                <p>Atlas's Agent Mode will browse and provide:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Historical context if it's a founding document or historical text</li>
                    <li>Author background and their typical themes</li>
                    <li>Scientific concept explanations if it's a science passage</li>
                    <li>Common question patterns for this passage type</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Why this works:</strong> Background knowledge helps you read faster and comprehend deeper. Studies show students with context answer 15-20% more questions correctly.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step-box">
                <h3>Phase 2: Active Reading with Atlas Support (5-6 minutes)</h3>
                <p>Read the passage actively without asking Atlas questions yet. <strong>Annotate as you go:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Underline main ideas and topic sentences</li>
                    <li>Circle transition words (however, therefore, in contrast)</li>
                    <li>Mark shifts in tone or perspective</li>
                    <li>Note any confusing sections to ask Atlas about after reading</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>After reading, ask Atlas: <em>"Summarize the main argument of this passage in 2-3 sentences. What is the author's primary purpose?"</em></p>
                
                <p>Compare your understanding to Atlas's summary. If they differ significantly, you may have misread—review the passage again.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step-box">
                <h3>Phase 3: Answer Questions (8-9 minutes)</h3>
                <p>Answer all questions <strong>without Atlas</strong>—this simulates real test conditions. Mark questions you're unsure about.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step-box">
                <h3>Phase 4: Mistake Analysis with Atlas (10-15 minutes per passage)</h3>
                <p>This is where the magic happens. For <strong>every question you got wrong or guessed on</strong>, use this prompt structure:</p>
                
                <code>"I answered Question [#] as [YOUR ANSWER], but the correct answer is [CORRECT ANSWER]. The question asks: [PASTE QUESTION]. Here's the relevant passage section: [PASTE RELEVANT LINES]. Please explain: 1) Why is [CORRECT ANSWER] right with specific evidence, 2) Why was my answer [YOUR ANSWER] wrong, 3) What type of reading error did I make, 4) What strategy should I use for similar questions?"</code>
                
                <p>Atlas will provide detailed analysis teaching you the pattern, not just this one question.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="cta-box">
                <h3>📈 Track Reading Section Progress</h3>
                <p>After practicing 4-5 passages with Atlas, take a full reading section and calculate your new score.</p>

            <h2 id="question-types">Using Atlas for Each Question Type</h2>
            <p>The SAT has 6 main reading question types. Here's how to use ChatGPT Atlas for each:</p>
            
            <div class="strategy-card">
                <h4>1. Main Idea / Central Claim Questions</h4>
                <p><strong>Question format:</strong> "Which choice best describes the main idea of the passage?"</p>
                
                <p><strong>Atlas strategy:</strong> After reading, ask: <em>"What is the central claim of this passage? Show me where in the text the author states or implies this claim."</em> Atlas will identify the thesis and point to supporting evidence. Compare this to your answer.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Common mistake Atlas helps fix:</strong> Confusing a supporting detail with the main idea. Atlas teaches you to distinguish big-picture claims from examples.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="strategy-card">
                <h4>2. Textual Evidence Questions</h4>
                <p><strong>Question format:</strong> "Which lines provide the best evidence for the answer to the previous question?"</p>
                
                <p><strong>Atlas strategy:</strong> Paste the previous question and all four answer choices. Ask: <em>"For each answer choice, find the lines that would support it. Then explain why the correct evidence is stronger than the others."</em></p>
                
                <p><strong>Common mistake Atlas helps fix:</strong> Choosing evidence that seems related but doesn't actually support the specific claim. Atlas shows you how to trace direct logical connections.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="strategy-card">
                <h4>3. Inference Questions</h4>
                <p><strong>Question format:</strong> "Based on the passage, it can reasonably be inferred that..."</p>
                
                <p><strong>Atlas strategy:</strong> Ask: <em>"For this inference question, show me the passage clues that lead to [CORRECT ANSWER]. Then explain why the other answer choices require assumptions not supported by the text."</em></p>
                
                <p><strong>Common mistake Atlas helps fix:</strong> Making inferences that sound logical but aren't supported by passage text. Atlas teaches you to stay grounded in textual evidence.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="strategy-card">
                <h4>4. Vocabulary in Context</h4>
                <p><strong>Question format:</strong> "As used in line X, 'Y' most nearly means..."</p>
                
                <p><strong>Atlas strategy:</strong> Paste the sentence with the word. Ask: <em>"Explain how the word '[WORD]' is used in this specific context. What clues in the surrounding sentences indicate its meaning here?"</em></p>
                
                <p><strong>Common mistake Atlas helps fix:</strong> Choosing the most common definition instead of the contextual meaning. Atlas shows you how context clues determine word meaning.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="strategy-card">
                <h4>5. Rhetorical Strategy / Purpose Questions</h4>
                <p><strong>Question format:</strong> "The author uses [example/metaphor/quote] primarily to..."</p>
                
                <p><strong>Atlas strategy:</strong> Ask: <em>"Why did the author include this [example/quote/metaphor] at this specific point in the passage? How does it support their overall argument?"</em></p>
                
                <p><strong>Common mistake Atlas helps fix:</strong> Describing what the example is instead of why the author used it. Atlas teaches you to focus on rhetorical purpose.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="strategy-card">
                <h4>6. Paired Passage Comparison</h4>
                <p><strong>Question format:</strong> "Unlike the author of Passage 1, the author of Passage 2..."</p>
                
                <p><strong>Atlas strategy:</strong> After reading both passages, ask: <em>"Create a comparison table showing: 1) Main argument of each passage, 2) Tone of each author, 3) Key evidence each uses, 4) Where they agree and disagree."</em></p>
                
                <p><strong>Common mistake Atlas helps fix:</strong> Confusing which author said what. Atlas's comparison table makes differences crystal clear.</p>

            <h2 id="agent-mode">Mastering Agent Mode for Context Building</h2>
            <p><strong>Agent Mode</strong> is ChatGPT Atlas's most powerful feature for SAT Reading. When enabled, it autonomously researches topics without you having to ask specific questions. Here's how to use it strategically:</p>
            
            <h3>What Agent Mode Does Automatically</h3>
            <p>When you paste a passage and say "Help me understand this," Agent Mode:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>🔍 Identifies key topics, people, or concepts mentioned</li>
                <li>🌐 Browses the web for background information</li>
                <li>📚 Finds related SAT passage patterns and common questions</li>
                <li>💡 Builds context before you even ask for it</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>🎯 Agent Mode Power Prompt</h3>
                <p>Use this prompt to activate Agent Mode's full capabilities:</p>
                <code>"I'm analyzing this SAT reading passage [paste passage]. Use Agent Mode to: 1) Research any historical context or author background, 2) Explain any complex concepts or vocabulary, 3) Identify common SAT question types for this passage genre, 4) Find similar passages I could practice with. Present everything in an organized format I can reference while working through questions."</code>
                
                <p>Atlas will autonomously browse multiple sources and compile a comprehensive guide in 2-3 minutes—work that would take you 30+ minutes manually.</p>

            <h2 id="evidence-based">Evidence-Based Question Strategies</h2>
            <p>Evidence-based questions are worth <strong>40% of your Reading score</strong> but students struggle most with them. ChatGPT Atlas excels at teaching systematic evidence analysis.</p>
            
            <h3>The Atlas Evidence Analysis Method</h3>
            <div class="step-box">
                <h3>Step 1: Answer the Main Question First</h3>
                <p>Before looking at evidence options, answer the main interpretive question. Write down which answer you think is correct and why.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step-box">
                <h3>Step 2: Find Your Own Evidence</h3>
                <p>Before looking at the evidence answer choices, scan the passage and find lines that support YOUR answer. Mark them.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step-box">
                <h3>Step 3: Compare to Provided Options</h3>
                <p>Now look at the four evidence options (A-D). See if any match the evidence you found. If your evidence isn't listed, you might have answered the main question wrong.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step-box">
                <h3>Step 4: Use Atlas to Verify Your Logic</h3>
                <p>After selecting your evidence answer, paste both questions into Atlas with this prompt:</p>
                
                <code>"For Question [#], I chose [YOUR MAIN ANSWER]. For the evidence question, I chose [YOUR EVIDENCE]. Here are all the answer choices for both questions [paste both]. Verify: 1) Does my evidence actually support my main answer? 2) Is there stronger evidence I missed? 3) Show me how to trace the logical connection between evidence and conclusion."</code>
                
                <p>Atlas will show you if your evidence → conclusion logic is sound or if you're making unsupported leaps.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Common Evidence Question Traps (Atlas Helps You Avoid)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Trap 1: Related but not relevant:</strong> Answer choice mentions a topic from the question but doesn't actually support the specific claim. Atlas teaches you to check: "Does this evidence DIRECTLY support the answer, or just relate to the topic?"</li>
                <li><strong>Trap 2: True but insufficient:</strong> Evidence is accurate but too weak or general to support the specific claim. Atlas shows you what "sufficient" evidence looks like.</li>
                <li><strong>Trap 3: Supporting the wrong answer:</strong> Strong evidence that supports answer choice B, but you picked answer choice C. Atlas identifies this mismatch.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="common-mistakes">Avoiding Common ChatGPT Mistakes</h2>
            <p>Students often misuse ChatGPT for SAT prep. Here are critical mistakes to avoid:</p>
            
            <h3>❌ Mistake 1: Using Atlas During Timed Practice</h3>
            <p><strong>Why it's wrong:</strong> You won't have AI on test day. Using it during practice creates false confidence and doesn't build real skills.</p>
            <p><strong>Correct approach:</strong> Take all timed practice <strong>without any AI assistance</strong>. Use Atlas only during the review phase after completing questions.</p>
            
            <h3>❌ Mistake 2: Just Getting the Right Answer</h3>
            <p><strong>Why it's wrong:</strong> Knowing answer B is correct doesn't teach you why you picked wrong answer C. You'll make the same mistake again.</p>
            <p><strong>Correct approach:</strong> Always ask Atlas to explain <strong>why the wrong answer you chose was incorrect</strong> and what made it tempting. Understanding your error pattern is more valuable than knowing one correct answer.</p>
            
            <h3>❌ Mistake 3: Copying Atlas's Analysis Without Understanding</h3>
            <p><strong>Why it's wrong:</strong> Reading Atlas's explanation isn't the same as understanding it. Passive reading doesn't build skills.</p>
            <p><strong>Correct approach:</strong> After Atlas explains a concept, ask yourself: "Can I explain this strategy in my own words? Could I apply it to a new passage?" If not, ask Atlas for a simpler explanation or additional examples.</p>
            
            <h3>❌ Mistake 4: Not Logging Your Mistakes</h3>
            <p><strong>Why it's wrong:</strong> You'll forget patterns and repeat the same errors. Atlas can identify patterns only if you show it your full mistake history.</p>
            <p><strong>Correct approach:</strong> Keep a digital log of every mistake. Once a week, paste your log into Atlas and ask: "What patterns do you see in my reading errors? What specific question types am I struggling with?"</p>
            
            <h3>❌ Mistake 5: Ignoring the Score Calculator</h3>
            <p><strong>Why it's wrong:</strong> You can't improve what you don't measure. Without tracking, you don't know if your Atlas practice is actually working.</p>
            <p><strong>Correct approach:</strong> After every 4-5 passages practiced with Atlas, take a full timed reading section and calculate your score. Track whether you're improving and by how much.</p>

                    <p>The most effective prompt structure is: "I just completed this SAT reading passage [paste passage]. Here are the questions I got wrong [paste questions and your answers]. For each mistake: 1) Explain why the correct answer is right with evidence from the passage, 2) Explain why my answer was wrong, 3) Identify what type of error I made (misread, inference mistake, evidence misinterpretation, etc.), 4) Give me a strategy to avoid this mistake type in the future."</p>

                    <h3>Should I use ChatGPT Atlas during practice tests?</h3>
                    <p>No, never use ChatGPT during timed practice tests—that defeats the purpose of simulating real test conditions. Use ChatGPT Atlas only during the review phase after completing a practice section or test. The workflow is: 1) Take timed practice test without AI, 2) Use your SAT score calculator to evaluate performance, 3) Review all mistakes with ChatGPT Atlas for detailed explanations, 4) Practice similar passages with AI-generated recommendations.</p>

                    <h3>How is ChatGPT Atlas different from regular ChatGPT for SAT prep?</h3>
                    <p>ChatGPT Atlas has three key advantages over regular ChatGPT for SAT prep: 1) Agent Mode can autonomously research passage topics and author backgrounds while you work, 2) Integrated web browsing provides current information and can access additional practice materials, 3) More advanced reasoning for complex inference and rhetorical analysis questions. For basic mistake explanations, regular ChatGPT works fine, but Atlas excels at deeper context building.</p>

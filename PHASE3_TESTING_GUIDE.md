## ⏳ Manual Testing Required

### 4. Performance Testing with Lighthouse
**Status:** ⏳ **NEEDS MANUAL TESTING**

#### How to Run Lighthouse Audits:

**Method 1: Chrome DevTools (Recommended)**
1. Open Chrome browser
2. Navigate to the page you want to test
3. Press F12 or right-click → Inspect
4. Click on "Lighthouse" tab
5. Select categories:
   - ✓ Performance
   - ✓ Accessibility
   - ✓ Best Practices
   - ✓ SEO
6. Choose "Mobile" or "Desktop"
7. Click "Analyze page load"
8. Wait for results
9. Document scores

**Method 2: PageSpeed Insights (Online)**
1. Go to: https://pagespeed.web.dev/
2. Enter page URL
3. Click "Analyze"
4. Review both Mobile and Desktop scores
5. Document results

#### Pages to Test (Priority Order):

**High Priority:**
1. **Homepage:** https://satscorecalculator.io/
2. **Methodology:** https://satscorecalculator.io/methodology.html
3. **Blog Index:** https://satscorecalculator.io/blog/

**Medium Priority:**
4. **Sample Blog Post 1:** https://satscorecalculator.io/blog/sat-score-calculator-guide.html

**Optional:**
6. **Tool Page:** https://satscorecalculator.io/tools/sat-superscore-calculator/

#### Target Metrics:

**Core Web Vitals:**
- ✅ **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift):** ≤ 0.1
- ✅ **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint):** ≤ 2.5 seconds

**Overall Scores:**
- ✅ **Performance:** ≥ 80 (Mobile), ≥ 90 (Desktop)
- ✅ **Accessibility:** ≥ 90
- ✅ **Best Practices:** ≥ 90
- ✅ **SEO:** ≥ 90

#### Common Issues to Watch For:

**Fixes If Needed:**
- Add explicit width/height to images
- Use CSS aspect-ratio
- Preload critical resources
- Optimize image formats (WebP)
- Minify CSS/JS (already done)

#### Documentation Template:

Create a file `PERFORMANCE_RESULTS.md` with:

```markdown
# Performance Audit Results

## Test Date: [Date]

### Homepage (Mobile)

## 📞 Need Help?

### Common Questions:

**Q: What if my performance score is 75 instead of 80?**
A: That's acceptable. Focus on ensuring CLS ≤ 0.1 and LCP ≤ 2.5s. Overall score can vary.

**Q: The consent banner doesn't appear. What should I check?**
A: 
1. Clear all cookies and cache
2. Check if localStorage already has consent stored
3. Clear localStorage and reload
4. Check console for JavaScript errors
5. Verify consent-config.js is loading

**Q: Can I skip browser testing?**
A: Chrome testing is essential. Other browsers are recommended but not critical for AdSense approval.

**Q: Do I need perfect 100 scores?**
A: No. Aim for 80+ performance, <0.1 CLS, and <2.5s LCP. Perfect scores are not required.

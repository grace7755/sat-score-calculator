            <section class="about-section">
                <h2>Who We Are</h2>
                <p>SAT Score Calculator is a dedicated educational platform committed to helping students navigate their college preparation journey. We are a team of educators, test preparation specialists, and technology professionals who understand the challenges students face when preparing for standardized tests. Our mission is to provide accurate, accessible, and reliable tools that empower students to understand their performance and improve their SAT scores.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="about-section">
                <h2>Our Story and Purpose</h2>
                <p>The SAT Score Calculator was created out of a simple observation: students often struggle to accurately interpret their practice test results. Many students complete practice tests but lack the tools to quickly convert raw scores into scaled scores, making it difficult to track progress and set realistic goals. We recognized this gap and set out to build a solution that would make SAT score calculation instant, accurate, and completely free.</p>

                <p>Our purpose extends beyond just providing a calculator. We aim to demystify the SAT scoring process, help students identify their strengths and weaknesses, and support them in developing effective study strategies. Every feature we build is designed with the student's success in mind, ensuring that our tools are not only accurate but also educational.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="about-section">
                <h2>Why You Can Trust Our Calculator</h2>
                <p>Accuracy and reliability are at the core of everything we do. Our SAT Score Calculator is built using official College Board scoring tables and conversion charts, ensuring that the scores you see are as close to official estimates as possible. We regularly update our algorithms to reflect any changes in SAT scoring methodology, and we thoroughly test every calculation to maintain precision.</p>

                <p>Our team includes professionals with backgrounds in education, standardized testing, and software development. We combine educational expertise with technical precision to deliver a tool that students, parents, and educators can rely on. Unlike many online calculators that use outdated or inaccurate conversion methods, we are committed to maintaining the highest standards of accuracy.</p>

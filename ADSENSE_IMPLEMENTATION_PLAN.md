### Why This is Critical:
- **Required for EU/UK GDPR compliance**
- **Google AdSense requirement for European traffic**
- **Without CMP, ads may not serve to EU users**

### What's Currently Missing:

### Required Implementation:

1. **Choose & Integrate Google-Certified CMP**
   Options:
   - CookieYes (recommended, easy integration)
   - OneTrust
   - Cookiebot
   - Any TCF-certified CMP

2. **Implement Google Consent Mode v2**
   Required parameters:
   ```javascript
   gtag('consent', 'default', {

     'ad_user_data': 'denied',
     'ad_personalization': 'denied',
     'analytics_storage': 'denied'
   });
   ```

3. **Update All Script Loading**
   - Delay Google Analytics until consent
   - Delay AdSense until consent
   - Store consent choices in localStorage/cookies

4. **Update Privacy Policy**
   - Add section about consent management

   - Mention ad personalization options
   - Add "Manage Consent" link that reopens banner

5. **Implementation on All Pages**
   - Add CMP script to all HTML files
   - Test consent flow on mobile and desktop

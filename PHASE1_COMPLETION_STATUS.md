   <!-- Google Consent Mode v2 (Must load BEFORE any analytics or ads) -->
   <script>
       window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
       function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
       gtag('consent', 'default', {
           'ad_storage': 'denied',
           'ad_user_data': 'denied',
           'ad_personalization': 'denied',
           'analytics_storage': 'denied',
           'functionality_storage': 'granted',
           'personalization_storage': 'denied',
           'security_storage': 'granted',
           'wait_for_update': 500
       });
       // Note: Analytics and AdSense will be loaded by consent-config.js after user consent

## üìû QUESTIONS OR ISSUES?

If you encounter any issues during manual integration:

2. **Analytics still loading without consent:** Verify old analytics code was removed
3. **Styling issues:** Check that CSS is being applied (inline styles in banner code)
4. **Functionality not working:** Open browser console and check for JavaScript errors
